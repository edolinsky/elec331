#ELEC 331 Wireshark DNS Lab

1. Run nslookup to obtain the IP address of a Web server in Asia. What is the IP
address of that server?
www.japan.go.jp has IPv4 address of 202.32.211.142 and
IPv6 address of 2001:240:177:21::14.

2. Run nslookup to determine the authoritative DNS servers for a university in
Europe.
The authoritative DNS server for www.ethz.ch (ETH Zurich) is dummy-ne.ethz.ch.

3. Run nslookup so that one of the DNS servers obtained in Question 2 is queried
for the mail servers for Yahoo! mail. What is its IP address?
The IP address of the DNS server is 129.132.243.94, but the lookup for the
yahoo mailserver times out. However, by using mail.yahoo.com as a DNS server,
I found its IP address to be 98.136.189.41.

4. Locate the DNS query and response messages. Are then sent over UDP or TCP?
The DNS query and response messages are sent over UDP.

5. What is the destination port for the DNS query message? What is the source
port of DNS response message?
The destination and source port of the DNS query message and response message
(respectively) is 53.

6. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Use ipconfig to determine
the IP address of your local DNS server. Are these two IP addresses the same?
The DNS query message is sent to 128.238.29.23, while the IP address of my local
DNS server is 10.0.0.1 (my home router). However, I am using the provided packet
traces for this part of the lab, and these two IP addresses would both be
10.0.0.1 in the case that I traced this DNS query myself.

7. Examine the DNS query message. What “Type” of DNS query is it? Does the
query message contain any “answers”?
The DNS query is of 'Standard' type, and does not contain any "answers".

8. Examine the DNS response message. How many “answers” are provided? What
do each of these answers contain?
Two answers are provided, containing two different type A, class IN IP addresses
for www.ietf.org (132.151.6.75 and 65.246.255.51).

9. Consider the subsequent TCP SYN packet sent by your host. Does the
destination IP address of the SYN packet correspond to any of the IP addresses
provided in the DNS response message?
Yes, the destination IP address of the SYN packet corresponds to the first
address provided in the DNS response message.

10. This web page contains images. Before retrieving each image, does your host
issue new DNS queries?
No, the host does not issue new DNS queries before retrieving each image.

11. What is the destination port for the DNS query message? What is the source
port of DNS response message?
The destination port for the DNS query message and the source port of the DNS
response message is 53.

12. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Is this the IP address of
your default local DNS server?
The DNS query message is sent to 128.238.29.22. This would be the IP address of
my default local DNS server, as I am using the provided packet traces here. In
my case, the address would be 10.0.0.1.

13. Examine the DNS query message. What “Type” of DNS query is it? Does the
query message contain any “answers”?
The DNS query is of 'Standard' type, and does not contain any Answers.

14. Examine the DNS response message. How many “answers” are provided? What
do each of these answers contain?
One answer is provided, containing the type A, class IN IP address of 18.7.22.83
for www.mit.edu. A set of Authoritative nameservers and additional records is
also provided.

15. Provide a screenshot.

16. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Is this the IP address of
your default local DNS server?
The DNS query message is sent to 128.238.29.22, the IP address of the user's
default local DNS server (once again, I am using the provided traces).

17. Examine the DNS query message. What “Type” of DNS query is it? Does the
query message contain any “answers”?
The query is of 'Standard' type, and the query message does not contain any
answers.

18. Examine the DNS response message. What MIT nameservers does the response
message provide? Does this response message also provide the IP addresses of the
MIT namesers?
The MIT nameservers provided by the response message are as follows:
  * bitsy.mit.edu
  * strawb.mit.edu
  *w20ns.mit.edu

19. Provide a screenshot.

20. To what IP address is the DNS query message sent? Is this the IP address of
your default local DNS server? If not, what does the IP address correspond to?
The DNS query message is sent to 18.72.0.3, which is not the IP address of the
user's local DNS server, but the IP address of bitsy.mit.edu, the nameserver we
requested in the nslookup command.

21. Examine the DNS query message. What “Type” of DNS query is it? Does the
query message contain any “answers”?
The DNS query is of 'Standard' type, and does not contain any answers.

22. Examine the DNS response message. How many “answers” are provided? What
does each of these answers contain?
One answer is included in the response, containing a type A, class IN IP address
(218.36.94.200) for www.aiit.or.kr. The response also contains a list of
authoritative nameservers and additional records for the requested domain.

23. Provide a screenshot.
